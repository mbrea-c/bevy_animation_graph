# Migration guide: 0.8 to 0.9

The 0.9 update brings many breaking changes to the serialization format. These
changes were necessary to solve long-standing issues with the library.

## Migration through the editor

1. I have added a migration script to `contrib/migration_script.sh`. When run
   without any arguments, this script will will
   - Create a `migration-tmp-dir-RANDOM_UUID` folder in the current working
     directory.
   - Clone and build both the v0.8 editor and v0.9 editor in that subdirectory.
   - Copy your assets folder into that subdirectory, in order to use as
     reference throughout the migration.
   - Launch both editors side to side. The v0.9 editor will be opened on your
     current assets folder, whereas the v0.8 editor will be opened on the
     reference copy under the migration subdirectory.

   You should copy this script somewhere convenient.

1. Move to the root directory of the project you want to migrate. Then run

   ```bash
   bash path/to/migration_script.sh
   ```

   Two editors will open side to side.
   1. If you have already run the script before and there's already a
      `migration-tmp-dir-RANDOM_UUID` folder in your current working directory,
      you can continue that migration using

      ```bash
      bash path/to/migration_script.sh -c migration-tmp-dir-RANDOM_UUID
      ```

1. You can now use the old editor as a reference to recreate your animation
   graphs, FSMs, etc.
